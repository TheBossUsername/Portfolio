      <h1>A Brief History</h1>
      <p>I grew up in Alberta, Canada, in a small town of only 500 people. After Highschool I went on a 2-year 
        mission for my church to Nashville, Tennessee. When I returned, I pursued my passion for psychology until I 
        realized how much paperwork the job required on a day-to-day basis. That's when I decided to take a coding class 
        and fell in love with the logic of it. I then attended Brigham Young University - Idaho where I met my stunning 
        wife and we've been married since 2022. 2 Years later we had our beautiful daughter, who is growing up to fast.
