      <h1>A Brief History</h1>
      <p>I grew up in southern Alberta, Canada, in a small town of only 500 people. 
        There were no gas stations or stoplights for miles around. Finishing high school, I went on a 2-year 
        mission for my church to Nashville, Tennessee. When I returned, I pursued my passion for psychology until I 
        realized how much paperwork the job required on a day-to-day basis. That's when I decided to take a coding class 
        and fell in love with the logic of it. I then attended Brigham Young University - Idaho where I met my stunning 
        wife. We've been married for two years now and are expecting our first child this coming May. </p>
